#Factory Project - Team 9
Design Document

##Purpose / Overview
The goal of our project is to simulate a factory environment. In the factory, multiple devices will be interacting with each other to build "kits". These kits wlil be spcified by a user to contain specific "parts".

##Requirements
In addition to the Kitting Cell requirements listed on this page: http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci201/factory/TheKittingCell.htm, there are other requirements on the GUI side as well.

There needs to be 6 clients connecting to a central server:

* Parts Manager
	* makes parts
	* add / change / delete
	* representative set of parts
* Kit Manager
	* establishes what kits the factory can produce
	* assign parts to kits
	* add / change / delete
	* view the production schedule (what's to be made)
* Factory Production Manager
	* select a kit & how many to make
	* view entire simulation
* Kit Assembly Manager
	* Sees parts robot, kitting stand, kit delivery station
* Lane Manager
	* Sees feeders, lanes, nests, diverters
* Gantry Robot Manager
	* Sees gantry robot, parts bins, feeders, purge station

##Classes
In our implementation, the following classes will be necessary.

###Server - Peter
The Server is the "middleman" between Agents and the GUI clients. This is where constructors of the different Agents will be called, as well as establishing connections with the GUI clients. 

Each client will have two connections to the server on two different ports. This is done so that reading/writing will not be conflicted. Two threads will be created per client, and will be run after establishing connections. One will implement ReadAClient, the other WriteAClient.

Clients are identified as the first Request data received from them. Then, they will be referenced as appropriately. 

	Data:
		ClientReader partsMngrReader
		ClientWriter partsMngrWriter
		ClientReader kitsMngrReader
		ClientWriter kitsMngrWriter
		etc….

###ClientReader - Peter
This class implements Runnable.

	Method:
		run()
			- composed of a continuous while loop, forwarding calls from the clients to the agents, so they can process user controls that took place in the GUI.

###ClientWriter - Peter
This class implements Runnable.

	Method:
		sendData(Request)
			- sends the Request object, which includes commands and data associated with them, to the client.
			
###Request - Peter
This class is used by ClientReader/Writer, as well as Clients. Stores commands and data associated with them.
	
	Method:
		getters
	Data:
		String command
			- e.g. "MoveKitRobot"
		Object data
			- e.g. { int newX = 50, int newY = 40 }

###Gantry Robot - Chris
The gantry robot begins the simulation by bringing all of the parts bins onto the screen. The robot will move bins and dump them into the feeder. After dumping the bin into a feeder, the gantry robot will place the bin behind the feeder in the purge station. The robot will also take empty and purged bins into a storage room off of the screen.

	Variables:
	int currentX
		- X coordinate that gantry robot is currently located at
	int currentY
		-Y coordinate that gantry robot is currently located at
	
	int destinationX
		-X coordinate that gantry robot is moving towards
	int destinationY
		-Y coordinate that gantry robot is moving towards
	
	static int storageX
		-X coordinate that storage is located at (located off screen)
	static int storageY
		-Y coordinate that storage is located at (located off screen)
	
	static int startBinX
		-Starting X coordinate of the line of bins
	static int  startBinY
		-Starting Y coordinate of the line of bins
	
	Bin heldBin
		-Bin being held by the feeder. Used to move the bin with the feeder
	
	Feeder destinationFeeder
		-Feeder to drop heldBin at
	
	Arraylist <Bin> binList
		-Arraylist to store the locations of each new bin
	
	Imageicon gantryImage
		-Image for gantry robot
	
	Functions:
	receiveBin(Bin)
		-Gantry robot takes a bin from offscreen and moves it to its correct position on screen. Uses binList to find correct location
	dropBin(Bin, Feeder)
		-Gantry robot picks up the given bin and drops it into the specified feeder. After being emptied into the feeder, the bin is moved to the purge station.
	removeBin(Bin)
		-Gantry robot takes a bin from the purge station and moves it off screen to the storage location
	
	moveTo(destinationX, destinationY)
		-Moves gantry from current coordinates to the new destination coordinates

##Global Functions / Data
None

##High Level Architecture

A general flow for the simulation:

* Agent generates actions
* Server receives these actions (e.g. pick up kit from conveyor)
* Server processes the action, does logic (e.g. remove kit from the conveyor list)
* Server sends messages to clients about animation needed to be drawn. 
* Clients receive messages, animate as told
* Clients send back to Server notifying animation done
* Server responds to Agent

To accomodate the networking requirements, all objects that we draw will have two sub parts: Logic and Display. When the server receives a message from the agent, Logic will first process the necessary changes to the data, then pass the appropriate draw commands to the Display class. 

##User Interface

##Test Cases
- Writing a main method full of instructions, see everything works without server instructions
